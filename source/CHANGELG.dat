Version 1.5.1 (Early Alpha Build):
* Revamped Berserker with new Sprites, Sounds, and Decorate (Agaures, finalized by RoSKing)

Catastrophe Fixes:
* 64 Player support.
* All cvars have been moved to CVARINFO.
* Because of the above, all cvars have the "hns_" prefix now. See the CVARINFO file for all of them.
* Removed all instances of console command.
* Added a new command called "setup", run with with rcon to set all dmflags for hns. Check the alias in KEYCONF if you need to change flags.
* Properly clientsided a bunch of scripts
* No longer messes up the players settings (ie forcing hud_scale)
* No more ghost players when dying

Version 1 (Final):
* Finished a spankin' set of maps, HNS01 to HNS10, that are specifically designed for HNS play! You can still play any other map with HNS, too!
* Created a new method for the Vanisher fading that doesn't involve A_FadeOut, which seemed to be the cause of the crashes.
* Dying, respawning and then jetpacking as a Scouter no longer 'resurrects' your corpse.
* Fine-tuned the Rocketeer's rockets to behave closer to the Doom rockets.
* Tweaked the Hunter's shotgun to be slightly more powerful but with longer firing delay.
* Buffed the Vanisher's fade slightly while also reducing the radius of the Radar, balancing the relationship between the two.
* Adjusted the jump heights for various classes.
* Reduced the Rocketeer's total rockets to 25.
* Fixed an exploit in the Berserker scream where a player could press attack and the scream would not trigger.
* Fixed several potential expoits in the Berserker and Vanisher coding that could be triggered by toggling cl_run.
* Added an option in the controls menu to let you switch between the new Berserker scream and the old one.
* We've started on implementing crouching sprites for various classes! Hopefully we'll get this done sometime. (TODO: Vanisher, Teleporter, Terminator (both weapons), Scouter (both weapons))
* Started implementing sprites for classes that show their currently equipped weapon. Hopefully we'll get this done sometime. (TODO: Scouter Knife, Terminator Grenade)

Version 1 (Core 2):
* Made several big scripts clientside so hopefully we won't have crashes out the ass anymore.
* Added an option in the controls menu to bind a key to a dummy mod-specific CVAR (cl_showradar) to allow users to toggle the radar on and off.
* Fixed aspect ratio positioning of Scouter's Radar in an online setting.
* Scouter's Radar will now not detect Hiders that are standing still, except for the Vanisher, whose cloaking field gets detected all the time.
* Teleporter's gun now has significantly less firing delay, as well as the projectile being invisible and hopefully being able to maneuver through tight spaces better.
* Created an incremental bar for terminator grenade throw strength and jetpack fuel.
* Scouter's Jetpack has a finite amount of fuel that recharges like other ammo does.
* Scouter is now 'bright' when using his Jetpack.
* Made the Berserker Scream stop when standing still.
* Hunter and Scouter's recharge functions improved so that multiple types of ammo (or in Scouters case, ammo + fuel) can recharge at once.
* Vanisher now moves at standard Doomguy speed again.
* Tweaked the Vanisher's visibility levels.
* Tweaked the Scouter's Knife attack time.
* Gave the Teleporter's sprites and gun sprites a fresh coat of paint.
* Fixed the jetpack 'jumpiness' and made it more responsive.
* Fixed the 'Infinite Jetpack'.
* Done a few little graphical tweaks to the hud.
* Made the hud scale correctly, well...hopefully.
* Made it so player names don't display when you place the crosshair over them.

Version 1 (Core):
* New HNS-only map created by HeavenWraith! This map occupies the slot HNS04 and is our first venture into mod-specific maps. Give it testing!
* New graphics for the titlepic, credit screen, in-game help screen (F1), and intermission screens, including custom music!
* New custom-made full-screen HUD based off the one from Ultimate Simplicity! Thank Agent Spork for his kindness! (The standard status bar has new behavior as well)
* New sprites and sounds for many weapons, featuring new designs as well as smoother animation.
* Along with the new HUD comes a brand new tool, the Team Radar! This is exclusive to the Scouter, and lets him briefly locate within a short radius where both teammates and enemies are.
* Scouter is given a jetpack instead an abnormally high jump. No altfire shenanigans here, simply hit jump button again while at the peak of your normal jump!
* Additional and better optimized gore effects for those who love gibs. (Who doesn't?!)
* Rocketeer, Scouter and Terminator have new sprites.
* Rocketeer's rocket explosions can now push away Seekers.
* Teleporter now only loses a Teleport Charge (read: ammo) if the teleportation was successful.
* Blazer now has a turbosphere-esque fade when he moves.
* Buffed Vanisher's invisibility slightly at the cost of speed, as well as added a fade that appears when he walks, making him significantly more visible as he moves.
* Berserker, along with having a much cooler animation for his...Ahem, berserkering, now attacks at a faster rate, and it's easier to time his punches. He also um, screams louder.
* Scouter's Knife has been completely revamped and redone.
* Scouter's Pistol has been modified to become a Rail Pistol. Rail Pistol features a low damage railgun shot that helps teammates identify where he is firing to locate Hiders.
* Removed the Scouter's light amplification goggles in favor of his Team Radar advantage.
* Rocketeer now gains more momentum when rocket jumping.
* Terminator's Grenade now explodes after three bounces, bounces on water, and can hurt the Terminator.
* Teleporter Projectile now explodes when it hits the sky, teleporting the player, as well as some tweaks to hopefully make it more reliable.
* Teleporter now has a permanent radiation suit.
* Improved method of ammo and health regeneration.
* Improved footstep collision detection.
* The timer is even more flexible than before, processing floating value timelimits, instead of only integers.
~ For this reason, you may add '.18' on the end of your timelimit value, as is recommended to compensate for the 10 second delay in the official maps.
* Removed anti-cheating scripts, mostly because I am tired of changing clients' settings. Instead, server owners will have to rely on some CVARs to dictate exactly what settings must be maintained. Recommended server settings as of Version 1:
~ SV_UseTeamStartsInDM 1
~ SV_ForceAlpha 1
~ SV_ForceGLDefaults 1
~ SV_NoCrouch 1
