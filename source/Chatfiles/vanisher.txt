"Well then, let's begin."
"Heh."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"Do I hear footsteps...?"
"I shouldn't stay here..."
"Ever tried using Scouter's radar?"

[FragStrings]
"Heh."
"You aren't very bright, hrm?"
"Keep your eyes open, next time."

[KilledStrings]
"Oh."
"..."
"That's disappointing..."
"You saw me?"
"Must have been a fluke."

[RoamingStrings]
"..."
"Where's a good hiding spot..."
"Here?"
"Damn Scouter..."

[EnragedStrings]
"Hmm..."
"Ah, fuck off."

[DemoralizedStrings]
"*Sigh*"
"I'm losing to a blind fellow."

[WinStrings]
"Keep your eyes peeled, or this will happen again."
"Oh, you didn't see me?"
"Heh."

[LoseStrings]
"Blazer should stop giving away my position."
"I don't like it when people see me."
"Well, I guess I wasn't transparent enough."
